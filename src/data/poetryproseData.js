  `Dear Mama... 
My magical cocoon, the safe haven within the home walls of childhood Where rose-tinted flowers grew beside hope-laden trees, 
and n'er a mention of the wilderness beyond. 
A precious whisper with the sweetness of honey flowing from your lips, and the story (of my life) began with a prophetic... 
'Once upon a time' 
As I grew, so my spellbound palace slowly disintegrated 
before my eyes 
Shattered dreams, irredeemable. Their shards piercing my heart. Sleeping Beauty and Snow White 
stayed mute in their slumber, 
never kissed and awoken, 
No shape-shifting frogs. 
Knights in shining armour remain stupefied in picture books, 
Heroes are not interested in rescuing damsels in distress. 
Imaginary creatures are too busy to save the day. 
Neverland never existed, 
Wendy’s dreams were cut short, while she looked on in vain. 
The falsehood fairy tales that corrupted my childhood 
were nightmarish fantasies. 
Mama, your lies and deceit shredded my self-belief. 
Those hidden scabs of supposed 'nurture' 
remain unhealed, 
Untouched by 'happily ever afters' 
There is no easy ending to this story, no neat tidying up of loose ends. Instead, I wade deep through a murky reality, 
Holding out for a miracle that your lies are real.`,
`Our journey stays a priceless memory
I promised my return to continue the story
Then why is it that I feel the sorrow
That I’ll no longer be in your tomorrow.
Regrets feel wasted on my tears
For the time, though anticipated,
Let slide by hours, days, countless years.
The void leaves me dilapidated.
In sleep I float through and over the garden
The vast meadow of flower and clover
Emancipated from the fear, the burden.
The moments embrace me forever.
I long, hanging on the verge

Upon the glistening of the horizon your smiles emerge.`,
`When my abuela was young, she had a dream,
She dreamed of a future where her children wouldn’t be called stupid by their teachers for
painting purple jacaranda trees,
She dreamed of her children living out their dreams as scholars, not toiling as gardeners all day,
She dreamed of a better future for her family.
When my abuela was young, she worked hard,
She worked at the swap meet every weekend to earn money to build a house for her family,
She cleaned grandiose houses where she was called names and made fun of, just to keep food on
the table,
She made sure that her kids spoke their native language and worked just as hard as she did for
their family.
When my abuela's daughter was young, she too had a dream,
She dreamed of her children going to school without fear of being attacked by gangs,
She dreamed of getting an education, of going to college,
She dreamed of a better future for her family.
When my abuela’s daughter was young, she also worked hard,
She scrubbed toilets and cleaned bathrooms in order to go to college,
She studied and learned with students and teachers who doubted her and made fun of who she was,
She made sure her kids knew where they came from and worked just as hard as she did.
Today, I am young, a product of their dreams,
I dream of making my family proud,
I dream of taking advantage of the opportunities those before me never had,
I dream of a better future for my family.
While I am young, I will work as hard as my predecessors have and continue to,
I will continue to learn and study, while learning things they never learned,
I will occupy spaces and be present in places, they never thought of being in,
I will strive to honor my mother, abuela, and all who come before me by not forgetting where I
come from and working just as hard as they did.
My abuela and my abuela’s daughter had dreams,
My abuela and my abuela’s daughter worked hard,
I became a product of their dreams,
I will work to honor their dreams.`,
`because suits are uncomfortable. (So are dresses) 
I want to die happy 
whatever that means. I want to run
away 
from the mass delusion of
Persons, not people.
Keep to the right.
Use cursive.
I want to see
crayons that 
bleed   ou tside 
the 
lines, people walking through hoops, leaving
the last button open.

Listen:
everyone else wants to run too.
Look around at the shattered heels. A painting askew. The door 
wide open like the mouth 
of a cave. This is the scene
of a crime, the unveiling, the cracked 
loudspeaker. Slowly creeping
into late-night whispers, the scribble of a pen,
worn closets, there is a secret
not so secret
bursting out      unfurling. 


Happiness. Freedom. Sweatpants. (They are the same)
`,
`in the cold dank space 
of a basement room, 
she sat surrounded by the echoes of previous lives, yet so very 
alone. 
head down 
shoulders sagging 
drained eyes 
sad, wispy sighs. 
carefully lifted the pen: 
a living antique, 
weighty like a confession.

ink sinks, 
coursing through the timelines that have defined her life she walks discreetly
presses the paper to her lips, 
in silent prayer 
as it carries the outpourings from her heart 
across the corridors 
of a past 
a drop of ink on paper 
(a haunting mistake from yesteryear) 
hesitates 
then smudges the paper 
overwhelmed by pain, 
slicing through ancient
the droplet stains, succumbs to lost nostalgia.
painstakingly written 

an emotional shipwreck 
buried deep beneath a sonnet of grief 
then 
warmed by 
next 
a spark from the hearth 
reignites the slow burn fire 
flames fanned by the winds of change 
vestiges of hope warm your heart, 
lighten your load. 
the vintage pen honors 
your word 
your voice 
your world 
casting ancient shapes no 
silence can redeem 
pearls of wisdom lie dormant for aeons 
hidden
the brave spirit of 
the survivor, nay, thriver emerges, 
a treasure trove of inspiration 
the venerable pen speaks only the truth it finds weaving words into poems, 
vividly portraying pain to passion 
on a journey underlined by the
bleeding ink of pen

  `You stood in the chilly aisle of a well-lit pet store, bright lights straining your eyes. You’ve come here way too often, always for that one cat. Today feels different to you, though, and you creep up to the cat’s little crate. The contents inside were a few scattered toys and a blanket that had clearly seen better days. The nameplate read “Lucas, 2, Male, Friendly and excited to meet my furever family!”, and you scoffed at the mediocre advertising. Still, you glanced at Lucas, unable to help yourself, and watched the small, striped gray cat blink back at you. His sharp, golden eyes met yours in a hopeful glint and you found yourself quietly mewling back as if he could understand how badly you wanted to get him out of there. 
Fortunately, you’d received a paycheck from your typical nine to five job last week with a bit of a bonus sprinkled in, an offering once left dangling as an incentive to keep working hard. As soon as you got it, it was safely sealed in your bag, ready for that very moment. You were in a spending mood, and in a moment of faith, called the front desk to purchase Lucas, whipping out the respective cash and forms. 
Exactly one hour and 19 minutes later, you had a cat sitting in the backseat of your car, absolutely howling his tiny lungs out in confusion. As you entered your drab flat, you grabbed the cat carrier with gentleness that was uncharacteristic to you, and calmly set out the basics for Lucas- food, water, litter boxes, toys. 
A week of living with your new feline friend was enough to tell that the two of you would inevitably become an inseparable duo; Lucas, the chatty and amicable pal, and you, the quiet and lonely human. 
Lucas, although a cat by nature, was much more like a human than imaginable – eating dinner together, perched on the chair adjacent to you, or meowing at obnoxious volumes every time you left the flat to set off for work. He was different. Different from all of your human friends in that you two could communicate without a single word or sound passing between the both of you. 
Humans could be awfully draining in your opinion, always gossiping or making idle chatter when mingling. You got tired of it easily, and were much more “straight to the point” as your colleagues had so kindly put it at the last office meeting. You much preferred the quiet with Lucas, listening to the rustling of autumn leaves as you both drifted off to sleep. 
Still, having something of actual importance was strange for you, and having to bear the weight of being responsible for it was also strange. Sure, you said you felt your job was important to you, but you’d be fired if you didn’t. And maybe you’d said your family was important to you, but you had no one close by that you regularly saw so it was kind of easy to fib about that too.

Hobbies? You tried knitting one time, and gave tennis a shot, but you gave those up too. 
Time whirred by, and it felt as though your life was equally less idle now that you had an important responsibility in addition to all of your other commitments. It was nearly Christmas now, four months since you had spontaneously purchased Lucas at that cold pet store. 
You had been so wrapped up in due dates and deadlines that you hadn’t noticed how close the holidays were. Piles of holiday cards from grinning families towered on a desk, and a small tree stood in the corner of your bedroom where Lucas eagerly bit on the synthetic leaves. “Perhaps a time for change”, you thought, rifting through the cards to see if there was a family meetup. It had been a bit since you had seen your immediate family, and you were hopeful that there would be a nice reunion for the holidays, but nothing came up. 
A frown spread across your face, morphing into more of a grimace as you realized this would be the first time you would ever spend a Christmas truly alone. Sure, you weren’t always warm and welcoming, but having people around made you attempt an effort to be outgoing and fit in. Now there wasn’t even that opportunity.
You’d never wanted to go back home so badly, but couldn’t even pinpoint where home would be anymore. Would it be with Lucas at the flat? Your childhood picket-fenced house? Or perhaps your college dorm, where you’d supposedly ‘found yourself’? 
Waves of pain and abandonment washed over you and you found yourself curling up into the thrift store bought couch, Lucas perched on one of the armrests. Maybe you were being melodramatic, perhaps you were just being sensitive! If nothing else, you could get emotional, so maybe it was just that! 
Even as you tried to convince yourself that you were fine, that everything was just fine, you couldn’t quite believe it wholeheartedly. You were in a slump, that’s for sure. Lucas pawed at you, eager for pets, and looked at you as if to say “You really need to get up, make this better even if it’s bad.” Stupid of you to think that you were a catwhisperer, but perhaps that’s what you needed. 
You didn’t get up immediately. You slept most of the day, cried a few more times, but you got up and made cookies with Lucas. Frosting slapped over poorly baked cookies, countertops dusted with powdered sugar, Mariah Carey blasting from your cheap Walmart speaker. Things were looking brighter for you. 
Lucas kept you going, meowing for treats every now and then, even while you wrapped your own gifts. He circled your feet as you strategically placed every ornament on your poor excuse of a tree, and posed when you tried to take post-worthy pictures to up your Instagram game. 

It was like a younger sibling in a way, if that even makes sense. He was bothersome, yes, but he also was everything that motivated you to not roll back into bed and cry about everything the world was doing to sabotage your wellbeing. Sure, you loved his stripes, his chipped tooth that showed when he yawned, his love for coffee– to the point that he rolled in it when you spilled some of the beans accidentally 
That being said, Christmas changed the two of you. It wasn’t just that  both got along well with each other, it was that you could rely on one another in dire times. 
So, he sat in your lap as you pretended to be shocked about the gifts you gave yourself, sniffed your hot chocolate in disdain, and watched the small snowflakes flying by in awe. 
As the holidays came to a close, things weren’t the same as they had been. You were determined to make an impact on things in your life, things important to you, and maybe make a friend or two along the way. You took Lucas to the office with you, odd as it may seem, but everyone absolutely adored his calm demeanor. After a good two weeks of this little experiment, he had his own food and water bowl to meander over to when he was at the office. 
He brought something out of you that made you lively, and more social than you had ever been. Often labeled as “shy” or “the quiet kid”, it was a change of pace, but you found yourself bonding with colleagues more often than not, sometimes using your cat as a conversation starter. You were still introverted, and this isn’t meant to be an inspiring story on the change of your demeanor, but you were less of an outcast. Invited out for drinks after a hard day, or just to stay late to talk to your senior advisors, it was a strange feeling of belonging that you hadn’t felt in a good while. 
You grew alongside Lucas, maturing and enjoying each other’s company together in the moments of spare time you both had. It was a perfect combination of effort at your job and relaxation with the animal and people you loved the most, and you were hitting your stride. You felt like you were a part of the ‘group’, and as a perk of this new mentality, you were invited to every single Christmas party that your office threw. 
Lucas started declining though as time wore down his small body. He was becoming slimmer and slimmer and more frail as the months flew by. He wasn’t always by your side anymore, and sometimes he had to run to catch up to your pace when walking. He was slowing down, but “That’s just what time does”, you told yourself. 
Time was catching up though. You found yourself seeking out Lucas more and more as he was able to come to you less and less. You knelt down one April morning on the cold hardwood and gave him a quick pet on his stomach before noticing an abnormal bulge. Lucas howled and immediately jumped up, as if in immense pain. 
He was rushed to veterinary care as fast as your dinky little car could go. The waiting room was bright, just like that aisle of the petstore, but you could smell all the hand sanitizer and everything just felt wrong. Your leg wouldn’t stop bouncing from anxiety, and you put in your
headphones to block out all the sounds from pets in the waiting room. Lucas came out after three hours, wrapped in a blanket, eyes wide in fear. 
He had cancer. It was bad too, not the easily treatable stuff. The kind of cancer that would break your budget and your heart if you tried to make it better. You couldn’t fix this. He had maybe 6 months at best to live out the rest of his life. 
It was evident in the way Lucas looked up at you and slowly blinked that he loved you so dearly, and you were at a loss of how to continue. He had become everything, and he was being ripped so cruelly from you by Death herself. 
You tried to ignore his signs of weakness, making his life as comfortable and easy as possible while you soaked up his presence like a sponge. At night you made pleas to the all heavens to let him live just a bit longer, convincing yourself that Lucas would make it a day longer, a week longer than projected. 
The harsh reality was that he was scrawny now, rejecting food unless you hand fed him a specific type. He wasn’t playful anymore, and you barely heard his mewls that convinced you to buy him that one day. You were losing Lucas. He was letting go. 
It was May now, and you were still caring for Lucas regularly. You sped home, ready to complete your new routine to go hand-feed him, but opened the door to see him crouched on your rug. He was practically shivering, and when you came over to smooth his rugged fur, he howled. This was not a howl of greeting or welcoming. He was in pure agony. 
It was time for him, and you both knew it. His little clock was slowing down now and time had caught up to him. You needed this to be as painless for him as possible, so, as calmly as you could, you rushed Lucas back to that horrible veterinary care that he was first diagnosed at. You didn’t care how many cars honked at you, how many people you had to cut off to get there. Your pain and grief had to be put aside for him. 
Back in that horrid building, you passed him over to the vet, a young woman with soft smile lines, wrapped in a blanket. You gripped onto him for a second, the desire tugging at your heart to keep him a little longer, begging for familiarity and rejecting the change. You let go and gave him a final pet on his head, a comfort for you both. 
The vet looked over at you in a brief moment of shock after registering an anesthetic into him, “I’m so sorry for your loss but he’s already gone. I think he was ready to leave when you handed him over.” 
You didn’t cry until you left the building, even though the truth was now cemented in time. It felt naive of you to think time would go easily on you when you had discovered something that brought true joy to your life. Regret and memories racked through your head and you felt yourself curling up in anger at yourself. 
You had to move on, though. For him and for you. You distract yourself everyday, not leaving much time for grief because you would undoubtedly spiral into a state of sadness that would be hard to come back from. Parties, meet-ups, workouts, name an activity and you probably did it to fill the time. Despite this, you did allow yourself one measly week to grieve the week of Christmas, you didn’t go out and visit your family or party with friends. You stayed at your flat alone, but no longer afraid of the desolation and abandonment because this was a way of honoring what time had stolen. 

You made sugar cookies complete with horrendous attempts of decorations, sprinkles littering your well-used kitchen table. You hung up an ornament in honor of Lucas on that same plastic tree, and watched the littering of snowflakes on the frosty ground. Lifting your hot chocolate in a salute, you whispered into the delicate air, “Thank you, buddy. You made life worth living.”

  `The book that was once so precariously placed on the shelf tipped backward and splayed itself open on my feet. The force of the impact cracked the spine, causing multiple pages to fly out, and flutter in the air around me. I stared at the pages in motion and realized how they will never return back to the book that they once were, bound together by glue and thread. Even if I pick up the pages from the floor and attempt to put them back as they were, they will never fit quite the same again. Like an altered jigsaw piece with no match or an ill-fitting item of clothing, grown out of and worn out. Just like how we will never return back to who we once were, destined to an ever-changing state that is life. Colors vary in their brightness (or lack thereof) throughout time, never appearing the same again. Sharp edges lose their corners and soft sides gain their rough points. I am not the person I was yesterday, the day before, or the month before that. And I never will be again, so how could I ever look the past in the eye and expect to be the same again?`, `I woke up on a Friday morning. I was preparing for the weekend. It was very cold. I thought the farm lost power again. I blindly tried to find extra blankets to stay warm. After accepting that it was not going to get any warmer, I prepared myself to rush out of bed to put some clothes on. Frantically pulling a pink hoodie over my head, I noticed that my window had been left open all night. My cat loved to listen to the snow falling and to the rabbits maneuvering through the snow, so I had forgotten to close it. However, I had very little time to dwell on it as I was putting together an overnight bag. The snow was normal but the storm canceled school for two days. My parents could not take another day off work for me so I had to go over to my grandmother’s house. I ate my breakfast slowly, as I did not have to rush to the bus like I usually do. My dad took the time to make me an omelet with what looked like onions, peppers, and ham. I finished the food and walked over to my grandmother’s house. At her house, the smell always comforted me. There was never anything to worry about–no stress, no anxiety, and most importantly, no homework. My grandmother always made mac and cheese for me with the noodles that I liked. The noodles that looked like a swine's tail, all swirly. Her favourite pastime was collecting pigs. Ceramics, stuffed toys, pictures–you name it. With so many in sight throughout her home, they always made me chuckle a little. Why did she like pigs so much?
At least, I knew why I liked pigs so much. They always remind me of her.`,
